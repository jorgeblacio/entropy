1. Redis
2. Zeromq

## Needed external libraries
1. k_v_store_benchmark-master
..* https://github.com/gtotoy/k_v_store_benchmark

## Instructions

The source of the code calculations of entropy is available, you can use it directly on your code, there is also a compiled static library.

There is a consumer code for using with redis and the k_v_store_benchmark to test the entropy.
